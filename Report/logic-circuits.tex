In this section, we will be looking at some basic combinatorial circuits. We
use this as an entry point for hardware design, both due to the ARK
course\cite{ref:diku} at DIKU, and due to the book\cite{ref:ark} recommending
to read appendix C, which covers the basics of logic design, prior to reading
chapter 4, which covers implementing a simple MIPS processor. We are only going
to cover a subset of appendix C, as it should be sufficient as an introduction
to connecting simpler components together into a more complex network.

%TODO sig at det er fordi de andre ikke giver ny indsigt???

We start by looking at some logic gates, which implement some basic boolean
functions. Then we will combine these basic gates into more complex networks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A decoder, which expands an $n$-bit input into $2^n$ outputs.
    \item A half adder, which takes two binary inputs and computes the sum and
        the carry of the two.
    \item A full adder, which does the same operation as the half adder, but
        with an additional third binary input.
    \item a $n$-bit adder, by combining a chain of a half adder followed by
        $n-1$ full adders.
\end{itemize}

For each of these combinatorial circuits, we go through the theory behind it,
describe the procedure of translating the theory into an SME network and
finally how to test and verify the SME networks.

\subsection{Basic logic gates}
A logic gate is a circuit abstraction, which has inputs and outputs, and
computes the logic function that corresponds to the gates name, i.e. its output
values are based upon the input values. We are going to implement the following
logic gates:

\begin{description}
    \item[\texttt{AND}] - outputs \texttt{1} iff. all of its inputs are
        \texttt{1}, otherwise it outputs \texttt{0}.

    \item[\texttt{OR}] - outputs \texttt{1} if one or more of its inputs are
        \texttt{1}, otherwise it outputs \texttt{0}.

    \item[\texttt{NOT}] - outputs the inverse of its input, i.e. \texttt{1}
        becomes \texttt{0} and \texttt{0} becomes \texttt{1}.

    \item[\texttt{XOR}] - outputs \texttt{1} iff exactly one of its inputs are
        \texttt{1}, otherwise it outputs \texttt{0}
\end{description}
The full truth table for all of the four logic gates with 2-bit input (except
for \texttt{NOT}, which only uses 1 bit) can be seen in Table
\ref{tab:truth-table}.

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{cc|cccc}
        \toprule
        \texttt{Bit1} & \texttt{Bit2} & \texttt{AND} & \texttt{OR} &
        \texttt{NOT} & \texttt{XOR} \\
        \midrule
        \texttt{0} & \texttt{0} & \texttt{0} & \texttt{0} & \texttt{1} &
            \texttt{0} \\

            \texttt{0} \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{The truth table for the four basic logic gates. Note: \texttt{NOT}
    is only considering \texttt{Bit1}.}
    \label{tab:truth-table}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Implementation}
Implementing each of these four logic gates is straightforward: There is an
input bus with two 1-bit values, a process for each of the gates, and an output
bus with a 1-bit value for each of the logic gates. We do not need additional
input busses, as each process which uses the bus as input, receives its own
copy of the input in each clock. Furthermore, we only need one output bus, as
each process writes to its own bit within it. Each process takes the two bits
from the input bus, computes their respective logical function and sends the
result out onto its bit on the output bus.

We could have made a more complex process, i.e. one that takes the two inputs,
and computes each function. This would reduce the amount of bus connections,
but we want to make each process as simple as possible, when constructing the
processor, as this makes arguing for correctness simpler.

\subsubsection*{Testing}
To ensure that the processes functions as expected, we construct a tester
process, which sets the bits on the input bus to all of the values in the truth
table, and checks whether or not each process puts the expected value from the
truth table onto their bit on the output bus. We use this testing technique, as
it tests the functionality of the processes, without knowing how they work
internally. We could also just have printed the output values, and verified the
results our selves, however automating this reduces the time needed for
verification. How the processes are connected can be seen in Figure
\ref{fig:logic-test}.

\subsection{Decoder}
A decoder is a component, which takes an $n$-bit input, and produces an
$2^n$-bit output, where the bit corresponding to the input numbers binary
representation is set to \texttt{1}. E.g. if the input value is the binary
representation of the number 5, then the 5th output bit will be \texttt{1}, and
the rest will be \texttt{0}.  Note: the output bits are zero indexed, i.e.
there is also an output bit for the binary representation of 0.

A decoder can be made from a set of \texttt{NOT} and \texttt{AND}
gates\cite{ref:logic}. We need to have $n$ \texttt{NOT} gates, and $2^n$
\texttt{AND} gates. For each input, we split it into two, and send the copy to
a \texttt{NOT} gate. Then for each output, we attach an \texttt{AND} gate, and
give it inputs corresponding to the binary representation of the number
%TODO mangler ord.
E.g. if we get the number 5, the binary representation is 101, i.e. the 5th
\texttt{AND} gate gets input from Bit0, \texttt{NOT} Bit1 and Bit2. An example
of a 2-bit decoder can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:2-bit-decoder}.

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{An 2-bit decoder made by \texttt{AND} and \texttt{NOT} gates.}
    \label{fig:2-bit-decoder}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Implementation}
To implement a 2-bit decoder, we just need to connect logic gate processes,
which we already have. How to connect a 2-bit decoder can be seen in Figure
\ref{fig:2-bit-decoder}.

We could have made the decoder a single process, but we are trying to emphasize
connecting multiple processes together, in order to gain functionality.

However, making a scalable decoder is not trivial, as SME requires everything
to be known at compile time, and we cannot make a generic process, as these
depend on the names of the different busses. To solve this problem, we can use
C\# templates. For each input bit, we create an input bus. Then, for each input
bus, we create an \texttt{NOT} gate process, which takes the input bus
corresponding to its index. Then, we create $2^n$ output busses, and for each
of these, we connect an \texttt{AND} gate with its corresponding output bus.
Finally, for each of these \texttt{AND} gates, we connect the busses whose
logical \texttt{AND} will produce a \texttt{1}. E.g. for \texttt{output0}, we
connect all the busses from all of the \texttt{NOT} gates, for
\texttt{output1}, we connect all the \texttt{NOT} gates, except from the bus
from the first \texttt{NOT} gate, as this should be the first input bus.

\subsubsection*{Testing}
To test the 2-bit decoder, we follow the same procedure as with the logic
gates. We construct a tester process, which sends input to the logic gates, and
verifies the output from the \texttt{AND} gates. This is also what we need to
do with the $n$-bit decoder. However as with the $n$-bit decoder, we are going
to need C\# templates, as the tester process also needs a variable amount of
busses. Each of the two tester processes should send all possible inputs as
input.

\subsection{Adder}
An adder is an component, which adds two binary numbers together. As with the
decoder, an adder can be constructed by a combination of \texttt{AND},
\texttt{OR} and \texttt{XOR} gates\cite{ref:logic}. An $n$-bit adder is a chain
of two major components: an half adder and a full adder.

The half adder is the initial component in the chain. It takes two binary
inputs, and outputs the sum and the carry of the addition (See Figure
\ref{fig:half-adder}). The rest of the $n$-bit adder consists of a chain of
full adders, that take three inputs, A, B, and the carry from the previous link
in the chain, and outputs the sum and the carry of the addition (See Figure
\ref{fig:full-adder}). The combination of the components can be seen in Figure
\ref{fig:n-bit-adder}.

    Note: Input A and B are both inside the inputs for simplicity.}
    \label{fig:n-bit-adder}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Implementation}
The half adder and the full adder is made like the decoder, in which we have
the basic logic gate processes, and connect them as specified in Figure
\ref{fig:half-adder} and Figure \ref{fig:full-adder}.

To make the $n$-bit adder, we have to use C\# templates like we did when
constructing the $n$-bit decoder. We program it so that each of the input bits
has its own bus, each of the output sums has its own bus, and each of the
carrys have their own bus. Then we start by making a half adder, which has the
inputs: input A bit 0 and input B bit 0. The initial half adder outputs its sum
on sum 0, and outputs the carry on carry 0. Then we construct $n-1$ full
adders, where full adder $i$ (1-indexed) has the inputs: input A bit $i$, input
B bit $i$ and carry $i-1$. Each full adder has output $i$ and carry $i$ as
output.

\subsubsection*{Testing}
To test the adder, we construct a tester process as before. We start by testing
the two subcomponents, the half and the full adder, by giving each every
possible input, and verifying the output. For the $n$-bit adder, we make a
function that takes an integer as input, and sends it along the corresponding
input wires. We also make a similar function that takes the values from the
output wires and packs it into an integer. This makes the test more human
readable, and reduces the chance of failure, when hand encoding/decoding binary
numbers. There are two tests: the simplest addition: 2+2, adding two numbers
together that produce an overflow and finally a series of adding random
numbers together.
